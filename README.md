# Java Book Exercises (ed. Paraninfo)
In this repository I will upload all the activities carried out from the Programming manual by [Alfonso Jim√©nez Mart√≠n and Francisco Manuel P√©rez Montes (ed. Paraninfo)](https://www.paraninfo.es/catalogo/9788428342865/programacion--edicion-2021-) .

# File structure üìÅ
The file structure is divided by **units** each unit is explained later.
The **units** are a Netbeans Project in which each activity is a Package with its corresponding class and necessary elements.

There is a Package called **Functions** which has widely used functions.
 1. Keyboard reading.
2. Handling Arrays
3. Matrix Management
4. String handling.
5. Math problems

All this package is developed by me and I have used it to facilitate the development of the activities.

# Units
Topics

The following are the topics covered in each unit of the manual.

### Unit 1: Basic Concepts
This unit covers basic exercises to understand Java syntax, as well as other common concepts that are necessary to understand any programming language. The topics include variables, different types of operators, primitive types (sizes, ranges, and conversions), console output and input, the Java API, and a brief introduction to methods.

### Unit 2: Conditionals
This topic covers selection structures, nonlinear applications, single (`if`), double (`if-else`), and multiple (`switch`) conditionals. Extensive use of relational and logical operators, as well as revisiting the ternary operator.

### Unit 3: Loops
This unit covers repetition structures (`while`, `do while`, and `for`), as well as how to program applications that repeat sets of statements using loops. Has been made an extensive use of functions for the resolution of the exercises in order to not repeat code, although the functions will be explained in the next unit.

### Unit 4: Functions
This unit introduces the concept of functions, the advantages of their use, and implementation in code. The exercises deal with input parameters, automating functions, overloading, and writing programs that make use of recursion. Students will also learn how to make their first libraries in Java.

### Unit 5: Arrays
In this topic, we work with arrays to store multiple values in a variable. We create arrays of different types and lengths, in addition to performing the most common operations with arrays. Programs that make use of this element will be designed, modifying the length of the arrays at runtime without losing the data. Use of the Java API related to arrays and apply its use to troubleshooting.

### Unit 6: Strings
In this unit, we work with the primitive type `char`, using methods and functionalities. Additionally, we use the `String` class, performing advanced operations with text. We will work with the Java API to implement applications with text.

### Unit 7: Classes
This topic introduces the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). We write programs that make use of OOP to solve problems, making it easier for you as a programmer. We will decide if the attributes will be visible or not, for external and neighboring classes.

### Unit 8: Inheritance
The projects in this unit introduce the concept of inheritance, working with classes and superclasses. We will know the access limitations to the members of a superclass, we will override methods, use the main functionalities defined in the Object class, and use abstract classes.

### Unit 9: Interfaces
This topic introduces the basics of interfaces, defining abstract methods in an interface, implementing interfaces to a class, understanding interface inheritance, API interfaces such as 'Comparator' and 'Comparable', implementing anonymous classes and the use of class sorting in lists.: Interfaces

### Unit 10: Text Files
In this project you will learn the concept of exception and its types, manipulate exceptions, create exceptions, create text input and output streams using 'Scanner','FileWriter','FileReader','BufferedWriter','BufferedReader' and 'PrintWriter' and read and write to XML files.
